ive been thinking about making myself do crazy 16-hour programming binges (basically lonely hackathon) to be productive

i already read about it on reddit

People get upset when those with power use it and tend to call it abuse. The fact of the matter is that I created this server with the intention of having a place for CS students to come and feel welcome. Not be made fun of constantly and have shade thrown at them. Especially not by those that I entrust with administrator permissions. You can continue to play the victim card all you want, but there is a very long paper trail of evidence that shows you constantly displaying behavior that is not conducive to making people feel welcome. I have had four people come to me in person and tell me that they refuse to be a part of the server because of how constantly toxic it is, especially to new people and people new to CS in general. Your name has been stated several times as one of the people that makes others feel unwelcome. I gave you administrator permissions in the hope that you'd grow up a little bit and take some responsibility in helping maintain the server during times that I cannot. You've not changed in the slightest. It bothers me and it should bother you that @xEden a freshman who was apointed as an admin at the same time as you were has made a much larger contribution to the server while being exponetially more mature than you. At the same time, @milÏƒ has constantly answered questions and been extremely kind to server members while all you do is talk down to people and act like a sarcastic child.

SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON.
